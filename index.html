						<p>Kelsey and Matt met in January of 2014. Matt had recently moved back to Santa Barbara from Arizona, and Kelsey was about to start school in town  at Paul Mitchell. Both were focused on school and work,  but could not ignore the connection that they had. Matt took Kelsey on their first date to Red's wine bar in funk zone, and they have been inseparable since.</p>

					<div class="col-sm-12 mb">
						<p>Matt took Kelsey for a weekend getaway in Santa Ynez to celebrate their third anniversary. Saturday morning was a picture perfect day on the coast, and Matt had a day of horseback riding (and a proposal) ahead. Upon arriving at Circle Bar B Stables, Kelsey and Matt picked their horses, Traveler and Cream Cheese, and were off. Once they got to the perfect view point on their ride, Matt asked if they could get off their horses and enjoy the scenery. When Kelsey got off her horse and turned around, Matt was down on one knee. After enjoying the moment and the view, the two rode back to the stables and had a glass of champagne to celebrate. Later that day they drove up back to Santa Ynez and called family and friends to share the exciting news that they were engaged! </p>
